# Blockchain Playground

Playground to understqnd what this blockchain thing is about, and deploy a **smart contract** written in **Solidty** on **Ethereum**.

## Why Ethereum?

Ethereum is the most popular Blockchain, after Bitcoin. **Bitcoin**'s first meaning (use) is referring to Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency leverages a blockchain, which in the case of Bitcoin is called like the currency itself. The Bitcoin blockchain is designed to work as a framework for monetary transactions. In the frame of our society, it plays the role of the infrastructure represented by central banks, government regulations, and all the actors that legitimize, regulate, and provide stability to monetary transactions. On the other side, **Ethereum** implements a blockchain as a framework for a wider spectrum of social interactions, between the actors taking part at the blockcahin. It also has a cryptocurrency, the Ether, but not all interactions happening on Ethereum needs to involve the connected crypto currency. Examples of this kind of interactions are: the possibility to register and manage organisations, being a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations) one of the possibe organisastions. It makes possible to create agreements like rental agreements, without the need of the oversight of a third party or voting procedures.

For example Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, got interested in decentralized systems due to a negative experience while playing World of Warcraft. Blizzard, the company behind WoW, made a change to his favorite character, which negatively affected his gameplay experience. This incident highlighted to him the problems that can arise when a centralized authority has complete control over a system, and sparked his interest for decentralized systems.

To be honest even if Blizzard had published World of Warcraft through a smart contract, they could have designed the smart contract to include provisions allowing them to change any character at any time.

## Why a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is only one possible type of interaction on the blockchain: it is 'smart' because it is self-executing and the terms of the agreement are directly written in the code.

There are other basic types of interactions and actions on Ethereum which are not smart contracts, like: - Basic Ether (ETH) transactions: Simple transfer of ETH between accounts. - Account management: Creating and managing Ethereum accounts or addresses. - Network participation: Running nodes or participating in mining/validating.

Besides those, most interactions on Ethereum rely on smart contracts, such as:

- Creating and managing organizations like DAOs.
- Setting up automated agreements, such as rental contracts.
- Running decentralized voting systems.
- Deploying and operating decentralized applications (DApps), including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, games, and social networks.
- Creating tokens using standards like ERC-20 for fungible tokens and ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing assets like cryptocurrencies, digital art, and collectibles.

## Why Solidity?

Ethereum was shipped with Solidity, a Turing-complete programming language, allowing developers to create complex smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Unlike Bitcoin's scripting language, which is non-Turing complete and limited in functionality, Solidity enables more versatile and powerful programming. While Solidity is the primary language for Ethereum, other languages like Vyper also provide ways to interact within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Goal

- [ ] Write an hello world smart contract that anyone can run for a small amount of money. Make someone run it.

Blockchain is not only about the code, but also about the social interaction aspect.
